##List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **Arithmetic Operators**
    Arithmetic operators include +, -, /, *, %, ++, and --, these operators allow you to do calculations in your codes. I have already mastered this topic since I have learned how to use it in code during grade 8, and got further practice during this school year. 
2. **Comparison Operators**
    Comparison operators allow you to compare values; these operators include ==, ===, >=, <=, and !=.  I know how to use these operators and when to use them. This topic had been made clear to me since it is crucial to know especially when we are coding.
3. **Variable Declaration**
    Variable declaration uses 'let', 'const', and 'var' to introduce variables to the computer. During class, sir has explained when to use each declaration and also provided examples. Through this, I learned how to use variable declarations and when to use each of those declarations based on whether or not you want the variable to be redeclared. 
4. **Switch Statements**
    The switch statement compares the inputted value to the cases it states, and if the case matches the inputted value, a block of code is executed; if there is no match, the code under default would be executed. I know how to use this because it has been very useful if I dont want to do a lot of if-else statements.
5. **If-else Statements**
    If-else statements are similar to switch statements, but more versatile. I know how to do and utilize this statement since it had been introduced to us during last school year, and we continue to use this until now. 


##List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.

1. **JavaScript Syntax and Coding Conventions, specifically document.getElementById("idName")**
    I have not fully understand how to use this. This is because I get confused when to use it and how I can incorporate it in my Javascript.
2. **Continue Statement**
    I need further practice in this because I have never utilized it yet.
3. **JavaSCript Number Properties**
    I need further discussion on this because I am not that familiar with each property yet and how to use them.
4. **HTML Events**
    I need further practice in this topic because I have not fully grasped its structure and how to use it in codes.
5. **CSS**
    I am not familiar with its codes and statements yet and I also get confused on how to incorporate it in my JavaScript code.

##Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

To help myself understand these topics better, I will create a consistent study plan and combine both practice and research.

1. For the first topic, I will review the lgs and also watch tutorials.
2. For the second topic, I am going to practice by making small coding exercises that involve loops that use the continue statement to skip certain iterations. 
3. For the number properties, I plan to review the lgs and also to make a summary table of all of the properties and their function. 
4. For HTML events, I will practice by building simple webpages that use buttons, inputs, or mouse actions to trigger events. 5. 5. Lastly, for CSS, I plan to start by practicing basic CSS styles like changing colors, fonts, and layout. Then I will try to link CSS with JavaScript by modifying CSS properties through code.


##In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
1. **Effective Activities:**
    1. Doing codes along with sir
        When doing codes along with a teacher, it helps me see what is the correct thought process.
    2. Bonus Exercises and n exercises
        These exercises provides more practice which further deepens my understanding of the topic.
2. **Not Effective**
    In my opinion, there were no non effective activities done in class because each activity is practice and helped me learn and understand the lessons better.
